# Abstract
We describe a fully data driven model that learns to perform a retrosynthetic reaction prediction task, which is treated
as a sequence-to-sequence mapping problem. The end-to-end trained model has an encoderâ€“decoder architecture that
consists of two recurrent neural networks, which has previously shown great success in solving other
sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks such as machine translation. The model is trained on 50,000 experimental reaction
examples from the United States patent literature, which span 10 broad reaction types that are commonly used by
medicinal chemists. We find that our model performs comparably with a rule-based expert system baseline model, and also
overcomes certain limitations associated with rule-based expert systems and with any machine learning approach that
contains a rule-based expert system component. Our model provides an important first step toward solving the challenging
problem of computational retrosynthetic analysis.
