# Abstract
Generative models are becoming a tool of choice for exploring the molecular space. These models learn on a large
training dataset and produce novel molecular structures with similar properties. Generated structures can be utilized
for virtual screening or training semi-supervised predictive models in the downstream tasks. While there are plenty of
generative models, it is unclear how to compare and rank them. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking platform called
Molecular Sets (MOSES) to standardize training and comparison of molecular generative models. MOSES provides training
and testing datasets, and a set of metrics to evaluate the quality and diversity of generated structures. We have
implemented and compared several molecular generation models and suggest to use our results as reference points for
further advancements in generative chemistry research. The platform and source code are available at
https://github.com/molecularsets/moses.
