## Main Publication Abstract
Chemical reaction data in journal articles, patents, and even electronic laboratory notebooks are currently stored in
various formats, often unstructured, which presents a significant barrier to downstream applications, including the
training of machine-learning models. We present the Open Reaction Database (ORD), an open-access schema and
infrastructure for structuring and sharing organic reaction data, including a centralized data repository. The ORD
schema supports conventional and emerging technologies, from bench top reactions to automated high-throughput
experiments and flow chemistry. The data, schema, supporting code, and web-based user interfaces are all publicly
available on GitHub. Our vision is that a consistent data representation and infrastructure to support data sharing will
enable downstream applications that will greatly improve the state of the art with respect to computer-aided synthesis
planning, reaction prediction, and other predictive chemistry tasks.
