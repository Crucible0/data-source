## Main Publication Abstract
We demonstrate molecular similarity to be a surprisingly effective metric for proposing and ranking one-step
retrosynthetic disconnections based on analogy to precedent reactions. The developed approach mimics the retrosynthetic
strategy defined implicitly by a corpus of known reactions without the need to encode any chemical knowledge. Using
40 000 reactions from the patent literature as a knowledge base, the recorded reactants are among the top 10 proposed
precursors in 74.1% of 5000 test reactions, providing strong quantitative support for our methodology. Extension of the
one-step strategy to multistep pathway planning is demonstrated and discussed for two exemplary drug products.
