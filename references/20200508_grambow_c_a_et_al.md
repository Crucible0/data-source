## Main Publication Abstract
Reaction times, activation energies, branching ratios, yields, and many other quantitative attributes are important for
precise organic syntheses and generating detailed reaction mechanisms. Often, it would be useful to be able to classify
proposed reactions as fast or slow. However, quantitative chemical reaction data, especially for atom-mapped reactions,
are difficult to find in existing databases. Therefore, we used automated potential energy surface exploration to
generate 12,000 organic reactions involving H, C, N, and O atoms calculated at the ωB97X-D3/def2-TZVP quantum chemistry
level. We report the results of geometry optimizations and frequency calculations for reactants, products, and
transition states of all reactions. Additionally, we extracted atom-mapped reaction SMILES, activation energies, and
enthalpies of reaction. We believe that this data will accelerate progress in automated methods for organic synthesis
and reaction mechanism generation—for example, by enabling the development of novel machine learning models for
quantitative reaction prediction.
